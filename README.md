# MovieDescriber
A project in Machine Learning. The project consists of a prototype thats able to describe movies, in keywords, using the movie subtitle or similar text. A large collection of movie summaries is used for learning the system.

To view the code open the .ipynb file. To run it, clone the rep and unzip plot summaries. 
Note that learning the system takes several hours on an i7 cpu (running the iPython notebook that is).
